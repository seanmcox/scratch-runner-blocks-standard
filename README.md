# scratch-runner-blocks-standard
Implementation of the standard Scratch blocks and effects. (Not complete, and some implemented blocks are only pseudo-standard, but this doesn't include any block definitions completely foreign to vanilla Scratch.) Depends on `scratch-runner-core` for interface definitions implemented.

This is an Eclipse project.

See the `scratch-runner-main` for more detailed instructions.
